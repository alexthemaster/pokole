# üîó Pokole
Pokole is a simple URL shortener that uses NodeJS and RethinkDB.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Configurating Pokole is very simple, all you have to do is run the `npm run setup` command and you're good to go.

If you want to manually do this, you can always edit and rename the [config.example.json](/src/data/config.example.json) file.

Note: If you want to host static files alongside Pokole, create a folder called static in the main folder (where your JS file is) and put your files there. The default files can be found [here](/src/static).
## ‚úèÔ∏è Usage
Configure it and then run `npm start`, it's that simple!

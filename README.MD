# üîó Pokole
Pokole is a simple URL shortener that uses NodeJS and RethinkDB.

## üìù Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (12 or newer)
- [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)
- [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com) (latest)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
- `git clone https://github.com/penfoldium/pokole`
- `cd pokole`
- `npm install`
- `npm run setup`

If you want to manually do set up Pokole, you can always edit and rename the [config.example.json](/src/data/config.example.json) file.

## üìÇ Hosting Static Files
If you want to host static files alongside Pokole, replace or edit the files in the folder called static, which can be found in the src directory [here](/src/static).

Note: don't delete the 404 folder, since users get redirected there if a short URL does not exist (you can, however, replace it with a desired one)
<!-- to be used if pokole will be an NPM package -->
<!-- If you want to host static files alongside Pokole, create a folder called static in the main folder (where your JS file is) and put your files there. The default files can be found [here](/src/static). Also include a 404 folder with a index.html file (this is where users get redirected if a short URL does not exist)! -->
## ‚úèÔ∏è Usage
Configure it and then run `npm start`, it's that simple!
